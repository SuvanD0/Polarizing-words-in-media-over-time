      "contents": "\nIntroduction\nIn this project I hope to investigate the presence of the word\n“protest” and “riot” in Australian media. After searching the web I\nfound an data source containing article headline, content and publish\ndate from the Australian Broadcasting Corporation or ABC.\nImportance\nIts important to see if a news source is disproportionately using\nwords like riot in their publications because its an indicator that\ntheir publications have some sort of bias. The goal of this project is\nto develop a method of identifying the number of times a keyword is\npresent as well as displaying it.\nPresence of riot\nand protest from 2003 to 2021\nI graphed the number of occurrences of each word during each year\nsince 2003. This was done by grouping by year and summing the total\nnumber of occurrences per year. We can see the word protest in blue and\nthe word riot in red.\n\n\n\nConclusion\nWe can see there is no clear trend in this graph. This allows us to\nassume that there has been no excessive use of either word by ABC.\nPresence of riot and\nprotest in 2021\n\n\n\nConclusion\nEven as we analyze the specific year we can see that there is no\ntrend. Although this is not definitive proof that this source is\nreliable, it gives the reader a little more trust.\nSource\nMy Source of Data was from ABC-Australia *the link to download the\ndata can be found at <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/therohk/million-headlines>\n\n\n\n",
