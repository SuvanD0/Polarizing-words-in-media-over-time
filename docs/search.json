Many\ntimes in media these words are interchanged to achieve a certain\nmessage. I wanted to see whether there was a clear excessive use of\neither word in recent years by Australian media\nGoals\nTo determine if either word was excessively used Graph the\npresence of each word over years and also specifically in 2021\n\n\n\n",

      "contents": "\nIntroduction\nIn this project I hope to investigate the presence of the word\n“protest” and “riot” in Australian media. After searching the web I\nfound an data source containing article headline, content and publish\ndate from the Australian Broadcasting Corporation or ABC.\nImportance\nIts important to see if a news source is disproportionately using\nwords like riot in their publications because its an indicator that\ntheir publications have some sort of bias. The goal of this project is\nto develop a method of identifying the number of times a keyword is\npresent as well as displaying it.\nTable\nFirst lets take a look at some of the headlines in Australian News.\nIts always smart to take a quick glance at your data before you use it\nincase there are any glaring problems. Lets also add columns to tell us\nif the word Riot or Protest is present within the headline\n\n\n\n\nOk now that we took a look at our data, lets start graphing. To graph\nCategorical Data we need to first quantify our variables. To do this\nlets count the number of occurrences of “True” within each column. Once\nwe have a number we can group by year.\nNow lets graph!\nPresence of riot\nand protest from 2003 to 2021\n\n\n\nConclusion\nWe can see there is no clear trend in this graph. This allows us to\nassume that there has been no excessive use of either word by ABC.\nPresence of riot and\nprotest in 2021\n\n\n\nConclusion\nEven as we analyze the specific year we can see that there is no\ntrend. Although this is not definitive proof that this source is\nreliable, it gives the reader a little more trust.\nSource\nMy Source of Data was from ABC-Australia *the link to download the\ndata can be found at <https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/therohk/million-headlines>\n\n\n\n",
