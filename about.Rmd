## About Me
My name is **Suvan Dommeti** and Im a senior at Dublin Coffman High School 

## About the Project
My project, *Presence of Polarzing Words in Australian Media*, explores the presence of a pair of words("protest" and "riot"). Many times in media these words are interchanged to achieve a certain message. I wanted to see wether there was a clear excessive use of either word in recent years by Australian media

### Goals

*To determine if either word was excessively used
*Graph the presence of each word over years and also specifically in 2021
